# AI Detector Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for an AI detector project that aims to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text using a sentiment analysis model.

## Project Structure
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`models/`**: Saved model checkpoints.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the AI detector.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-detector.git
    cd ai-detector
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore and train the model.

## Training the Model
1. Open and run the `train_model.ipynb` notebook to train the sentiment analysis model.
2. Experiment with hyperparameters, embedding dimensions, and model architectures for optimal performance.

## Evaluating the Model
1. Open and run the `evaluate_model.ipynb` notebook to evaluate the model on test data.
2. Analyze the performance metrics and adjust the model as needed.

## Model Deployment
1. Save the trained model in the `models/` directory.
2. Use the saved model for inference in your desired application or environment.
